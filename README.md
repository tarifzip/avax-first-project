# Title:
Elevate Your Ethereum Experience with Solidity Token and Vault Contracts

# Description:
Embark on a thrilling journey into the realm of decentralized finance with our avant-garde Solidity smart contracts: token.sol and vault.sol. Delve into the essence of the ERC-20 token standard with token.sol, an exemplary suite of functions including transfer, approve, mint, and burn. Elevate your financial strategies with vault.sol, an impregnable vault designed exclusively for your ERC-20 tokens, offering seamless deposit and withdrawal capabilities while intelligently managing total supply and individual balances.

Steps:

1. Open Remix IDE:
Open your web browser and navigate to Remix IDE.
2. Import Contracts:
Copy the contents of token.sol and vault.sol.
In Remix, create new files named token.sol and vault.sol.
Paste the respective contents into each file.
3. Compile Contracts:
In Remix, go to the "Solidity" tab.
Select the appropriate version for the Solidity compiler (e.g., ^0.8.17).
Click the "Compile" button to compile the contracts.
4. Deploy Token Contract:
Switch to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
Select token.sol in the contract dropdown.
Click the "Deploy" button to deploy the ERC-20 token contract.
5. Copy Token Address:
After deployment, copy the deployed token contract address from the Remix console.
6. Deploy Vault Contract:

$ Select vault.sol in the contract dropdown.
Paste the ERC-20 token contract address into the constructor parameter for Vault.
Click the "Deploy" button to deploy the vault contract.
Interact with Contracts:
Once deployed, you can seamlessly interact with the contracts using the provided functions. Connect your Ethereum wallet to Remix to perform transactions effortlessly.
